# Battle - a web project with testing frameworks

## Set-up

- Clone the repo and pull it locally
- Run bundle to install dependencies
- To start server, run: $ rackup 
- Visit local host on assigned port
- Play game

## Playing the game

- The game is a simple 'battle' between two named players
- Enter two names and click 'Play!'
- Observe whose turn it is. Each player has 3 options
- Option 1 - Attack the other player. This deals a random amount of damage (0 to 9 HP, inclusive)
- Option 2 - Defend yourself. This guarantees that you will not sustain any damage if they attack next turn
- Option 3 - Put the other play to sleep. This has a 50% chance of putting your opponent to sleep, meaning they cannot act at all next turn
- A winner is declared when one player reaches 0 HP

## Highlights

- The test 'Successfully defend player 2', lines 19 to 31 in attack_a_player_spec.rb. Line 26 features an 'unstubbing' of a method call. This is necessary because the method has to be stubbed initially (line 20) to ensure a specific amount of damage is incurred by player 2 (line 24). However, stubbing the method also avoids the 'defend' functionality, which we want to then test for. So, unstubbing is necessary.
