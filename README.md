# Battle - a web project with testing frameworks

## Approach

There is the question of how to develop functionality: horizontally, doing the logic first then the web interface second; or vertically, implementing one piece of functionality logically and in the interface before proceeding to the next piece of functionality.

I think it is better to do it horizontally, as this will reduce the scope for errors and reduce the need for refactoring... hopefully. Though, I will only do the basic user stories before doing the interface, returning to advanced user stories later.

However, I am following the tutorial at the moment, so this question is moot.

I should use a vertical approach an another web project to allow me to compare the two approaches.
